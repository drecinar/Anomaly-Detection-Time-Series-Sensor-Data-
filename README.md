Anomaly detection is a technique that has been used for years to identify and extract outlier components from data. Many techniques, such as machine learning, have gained importance in anomaly detection. This study analyzes vibration levels using time series data obtained from accelerometers placed in different regions of a heavily equipped helicopter provided by Airbus SAS. Five different models were trained, and three different imputation methods were applied to the dataset. The results show that the 1C-SVM and LSTM models achieved the highest F1 score of 0.89 after training. These findings indicate that these two models effectively model helicopter vibration levels and provide successful results in anomaly detection. The study offers valuable insights into vibration analysis, which is an important step in terms of safety and maintenance optimization in the aviation industry.
